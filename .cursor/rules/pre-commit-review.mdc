# Pre-Commit Review

When the user asks you to help commit, push, or review files for publishing, run this checklist on all staged files BEFORE committing:

## Security Checks
- [ ] No API keys, tokens, or secrets in any staged file
- [ ] No `.env` files staged
- [ ] No credentials, passwords, or connection strings

## Privacy Checks
- [ ] No personal email addresses in file contents
- [ ] No local file paths (`C:\Users\...`, `d:\Freya-ai-agent-projects\...`)
- [ ] No private data that shouldn't be public

## File Checks
- [ ] `.gitignore` protects `.env`, `.cursor/` (except rules), and `docs/dev-logs/transcripts/`
- [ ] No duplicate or unnecessary files staged
- [ ] No files that belong in `.gitignore` but are being committed

## Code Quality (if code files are staged)
- [ ] No linter errors introduced
- [ ] No bare `except:` clauses
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials in code
- [ ] Consistent formatting and indentation

## Documentation (if this is a versioned commit)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated if needed
- [ ] Iteration doc updated if needed
- [ ] Dev log summary written for the session

Report findings as a table with Pass/Warning/Fail status for each check.
