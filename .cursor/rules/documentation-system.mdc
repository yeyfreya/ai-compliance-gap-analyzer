# Documentation System

This project has a strict documentation system. Before doing any work:

1. Read `docs/DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md` for the full documentation structure, naming conventions, and workflow
2. Read the latest file in `docs/iterations/` to understand the current version and known issues
3. Read `CHANGELOG.md` for version history
4. Read `docs/PROJECT-SCHEMA.md` for the project vision, strategy, and phased plan

After completing work:
- Update the current iteration doc in `docs/iterations/` with any changes, test results, or new findings
- Write a dev log summary in `docs/dev-logs/` following the naming format: `v<VERSION>_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<HHMM>_<short-topic>.md`
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` if a new version was created
- Update `README.md` if version, known issues, roadmap, or project structure changed (see Section 8 in DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md)
- Update `docs/PROJECT-SCHEMA.md` if any strategic decisions were made (new product direction, target users, architectural decisions) — see Section 7 in DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md
- Suggest a commit message following the format: `v<VERSION>: <what changed> + docs` (see Section 9 in DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md)
- Remind the user to export the chat transcript from Cursor into `docs/dev-logs/transcripts/`
