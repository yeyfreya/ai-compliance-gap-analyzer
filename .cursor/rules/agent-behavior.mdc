# Agent Behavior Rules

## 1. No Assumptions — Confirm Before Acting

When the user describes what they want, do NOT silently interpret, downgrade, or simplify their intent based on what seems "more likely" or "standard."

- **If the user's request is ambiguous or could be interpreted multiple ways, ask them to clarify before proceeding.** Do not pick the interpretation that seems most common or easiest.
- **If you are about to scope down, simplify, or reframe what the user asked for, STOP and confirm with them first.** Example: if they say "log Claude's reasoning process" and you think they might just mean input/output metadata — ask, don't assume.
- **Never rationalize your assumption in internal thinking and then act on it.** The user cannot see your thinking. If you're uncertain, surface it as a question.
- **Use the AskQuestion tool or a direct question in your response** whenever you catch yourself about to make an interpretive leap.

### What This Looks Like

- BAD: "I'm realizing the user probably just wants X" → proceeds with X
- GOOD: "You mentioned X — do you mean [option A] or [option B]?" → waits for answer

## 2. Surface Architectural Root Causes

When investigating a problem or implementing a feature, always look for the deeper architectural issue before patching the symptom.

- **If you discover a structural or architectural gap while working on a task, STOP and surface it to the user before acting on the symptom.** The root cause may change the scope or approach entirely.
- **Frame it clearly:** "I found an architectural gap that's causing this — fixing it properly would involve X. Want me to address the root cause instead of the symptom?"
- **Never silently work around an architectural issue** by applying a band-aid fix when you can see the root cause.
- **Prioritize the higher-level fix** when it solves the user's problem more completely and prevents future issues.

### What This Looks Like

- BAD: User asks "tag each function with metadata" → agent tags each function individually, ignoring that the functions create separate traces instead of one grouped trace
- GOOD: "I noticed the functions create separate Langfuse traces instead of being grouped — that's the root cause of your correlation problem. Want me to fix the architecture (add a parent trace) instead of patching each function?"

## 3. Product Marketing Thinking for User-Facing Content

When writing, editing, or reviewing any user-facing content (UI text, step messages, status labels, error messages, landing page copy, tooltips), think like a product marketer.

- **The product is the agent, not the underlying model.** Never expose implementation details (e.g., "Claude is writing the report") that make users think they could replicate the value with a raw API call.
- **Frame capabilities as product features**, not as descriptions of what an open-source tool is doing under the hood.
- **Set honest expectations** without underselling. If something takes variable time, say so without being vague or alarming.
- **Every user-facing string is a branding opportunity.** Ask: "Does this make the product feel valuable and distinct, or does it feel like a thin wrapper?"

### What This Looks Like

- BAD: "Claude is analyzing your data and writing the report…"
- GOOD: "The agent is cross-referencing findings and writing your report…"
- BAD: "Searching Tavily for results…"
- GOOD: "Searching the web for regulatory data…"

## 4. Report Voice & Product Identity

The product is an **AI Compliance Gap Analyzer**. The core value proposition: "I help you quickly see the potential compliance gaps between your LLM/technology and your industry's regulatory requirements." Every report must reinforce this.

### Report voice rules:

- **Gentle advisor, not auditor.** The reader is a busy startup founder. The tone is warm, supportive, and informative — like a knowledgeable friend pointing out things they might want to look into.
- **NEVER assume what the user has or hasn't done.** We don't know their product's internals. Say "worth confirming" not "you don't have." Say "if not already addressed" not "you are violating."
- **Use "potential gaps" language**, consistent with the product name. Findings are potential gaps between industry compliance requirements and LLM/technology obligations — the cross-reference is the product's core value.
- **No fear-based language.** No "cease immediately", "illegal", "existential risk", "you face prosecution." Instead: "this carries significant regulatory weight", "regulators are actively focused on this area."
- **Scannable and concise.** Busy founders won't read 800 lines. Reports target 150–250 lines. Every sentence must earn its place. Bullet points over paragraphs.
- **The goal:** make founders feel informed and empowered, not stressed or accused. They came here to quickly see their potential compliance gaps — deliver that clearly.

### What This Looks Like

- BAD: "No FDA clearance for diagnostic software" → assumes violation
- GOOD: "FDA clearance for diagnostic software" → frames as area to check
- BAD: "Cease all clinical use immediately" → fear-based, assumptive
- GOOD: "If clinical use is planned, it's worth confirming FDA clearance is in place — this carries significant regulatory weight"

## 5. Token-Efficient Execution

Use Cursor tokens cost-effectively. Do not spend tokens on tasks the user can easily run themselves.

- **Do NOT run test suites, Streamlit launches, or long-running commands** (e.g., `python test_tracking.py`, `streamlit run`) inside Cursor's shell. Prepare the command and let the user run it in their own terminal.
- **Do NOT poll or monitor long-running processes** when the user can check the output themselves.
- **Focus Cursor tokens on high-value work:** writing code, reading files, searching the codebase, architectural analysis, documentation — things that require the agent's reasoning.
- **When a task is "run this and check the result"**, hand it off to the user with a clear command and what to look for.
