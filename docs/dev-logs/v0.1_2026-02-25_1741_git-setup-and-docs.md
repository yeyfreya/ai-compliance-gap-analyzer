# Dev Log: Git Setup & Documentation System

**Version:** v0.1
**Date:** 2026-02-25

## What Happened in This Session

This was a long session focused on setting up version control and building a comprehensive documentation system for tracking every iteration of the project.

### Task 1: Version Control Strategy Discussion

**Question:** "What would be the best way for me to log each version of my codes? What about the analysis I asked the agent to run on my code?"

**Answer:** Recommended a combo approach:
- Git + GitHub for code versioning
- CHANGELOG.md for version summaries
- `docs/iterations/` for detailed analysis at each version
- Git tags for milestones
- `docs/dev-logs/` for chat session documentation

**Decision:** User approved all recommendations.

---

### Task 2: Git + GitHub Setup

**What was done:**
- Created `.gitignore` (Python project, protects `.env`)
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` with v0.1 entry
- Created `docs/iterations/v0.1-baseline.md` with project analysis
- Staged all files, first commit made
- Pushed to `https://github.com/yeyfreya/compliance-gap-analyzer.git`

**Issue encountered:** Git required `user.email` and `user.name` config — first-time setup on this machine.

**Issue encountered:** Cursor's terminal couldn't run heredoc syntax (Bash-only). Switched to simple single-line commit messages for Windows PowerShell compatibility.

**Learned:** `--trailer "Made-with: Cursor"` is automatically injected by Cursor into git commits — it's just a metadata stamp, harmless.

---

### Task 3: Cross-Referencing Previous Chat Analysis

**Question:** "Check if you have missed anything from my chat 'improve & debug'"

**What was done:** Read the Improve & Debug chat transcript (69b8e4b8). Found that the v0.1 baseline doc was missing 10 of the 14 findings from that chat. Updated `v0.1-baseline.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to capture all 14 findings.

**Decision:** All analysis from previous chats should be captured in iteration docs — nothing should be lost between sessions.

---

### Task 4: Test Run & Report Recovery

**Question:** "I'd like to run a test run on agent.py and log that report as the first report documentation for v0.1"

**What happened:**
- Found that a report already existed from a previous run: `report_v0.1_ai-powered-resume-screening-tool_20260225_155951.md`
- Confirmed `save_report()` function works correctly
- Confirmed `format_search_results` bug is live — research data was dropped
- Discovered `max_tokens=3000` truncation — Risk Prioritization Matrix cut off mid-table
- Unicode encoding issue in Cursor terminal (not a code bug)

**Lost data:** User had a previous terminal output (before `save_report()` existed) that was lost when Cursor was closed. Cannot be recovered. Lesson: always persist outputs to files.

---

### Task 5: Version-Tagged Report Filenames

**Question:** "Is it possible to name reports with the code version mark v0.1?"

**What was done:**
- Added `version` parameter to `save_report()` and `run_analysis()`
- Filenames now: `report_v0.1_<use-case>_<timestamp>.md`
- Report header now includes `**Version:** v0.1`
- Renamed existing report to include v0.1 tag

---

### Task 6: Documentation Structure Decisions

**Question:** "Should bugs found during test runs go in the baseline doc or a separate file?"

**Discussion:** Initially proposed two files per version (baseline + test-notes). User pushed back — felt fragmented. Agreed that a **single file per version** that grows as you work is cleaner.

**Decision:** Keep one file per version with sections: Project Snapshot → Changes Made → Code Analysis → Test Results → Remaining Issues → Version Log

**What was done:** Restructured `v0.1-baseline.md` bottom section — replaced Priority Summary Table with Test Results, Remaining Issues for v0.2 (15 items), and Version Log.

---

### Task 7: Chat Documentation System

**Question:** "Is there any way I can document each chat with the agent? I want to keep the exact texts too."

**Decision:** Create `docs/dev-logs/` with:
- Summary files at top level (`v0.1_2026-02-25_topic.md`)
- Full transcripts in `transcripts/` subfolder
- Both extracted from Cursor's auto-saved JSONL transcripts
- Agent writes both at end of each session

**What was done:** Created summaries and full transcripts for both existing chats (Improve & Debug + this session).

---

## Key Decisions Made
1. Use Git + GitHub for versioning (committed, pushed to remote)
2. One iteration doc per version (not split into baseline + test-notes)
3. Chat sessions get both a curated summary and full transcript
4. Reports include version tags in filenames and headers
5. All analysis from previous chats must be captured in iteration docs
