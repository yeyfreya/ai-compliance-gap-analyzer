# Dev Log: Pre-Merge Review for LinkedIn Launch

**Version:** v0.5
**Date:** 2026-03-01

## What Happened in This Session

### Task 1: Full Pre-Commit Review
**Question:** Check all files and code for merge readiness into main.
**Answer/Solution:** Ran the full pre-commit checklist (security, privacy, code quality, version alignment, documentation completeness) using three parallel review agents.
**Findings:**
- **3 code issues:** `save_report()` default version was `"v0.1"` (stale), unused `datetime` import in `streamlit_app.py`, local file paths exposed in `.cursor/rules/pre-commit-review.mdc` and `docs/dev-logs/v0.1_...`
- **3 stale README sections:** "Risk Prioritization Matrix" → "Compliance Gap Matrix", "2–3 minutes" → "about a minute", old format description → new 5-section format
- **All other checks passed:** no secrets, no bare excepts, imports aligned, Supabase schema matched, all 7 documentation checks passed
**Files modified:** `agent.py`, `streamlit_app.py`, `.cursor/rules/pre-commit-review.mdc`, `docs/dev-logs/v0.1_2026-02-25_1800_pre-commit-review.md`, `README.md`

### Task 2: Root Cause — Agents Missing README Updates
**Question:** Why do agents keep missing README updates?
**Answer/Solution:** The documentation guide's "When to Update README" trigger table only covered structural changes (version numbers, roadmap, file tree). No trigger existed for "product behavior changed" — so when v0.5 changed report timing, terminology, and format, agents updated version numbers but left prose stale.
**Decision:** Added new trigger row "Product behavior changed" to documentation guide and expanded the `documentation-system.mdc` rule to explicitly mention product behavior.
**Files modified:** `docs/DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md` (Section 8: new trigger row + new content accuracy rule), `.cursor/rules/documentation-system.mdc` (expanded README reminder)

### Task 3: Roadmap Item Assessment
**Question:** Does current report structure meet "Consistent detailed report structure (full template enforcement)"?
**Answer/Solution:** Partially. Template is defined (5 sections, heading rules, bold patterns), and reports generally follow it. But LLM non-determinism causes minor formatting drift between runs (issue #32). Recommended keeping the roadmap item unchecked — honest for LinkedIn viewers and shows an active roadmap.

## Key Decisions Made

1. Keep "Consistent detailed report structure" unchecked in roadmap — partially met, not fully enforced
2. Add "product behavior changed" as README update trigger — prevents future stale prose
3. Sanitize local file paths from committed files
