# Dev Log: Project Schema Creation & Documentation System Integration

**Version:** v0.4
**Date:** 2026-02-27

## What Happened in This Session

### Task 1: Create PROJECT-SCHEMA.md
**Question:** Summarize the project vision and strategy from all chat transcripts into a separate local file, sourced so it can be verified.
**Answer/Solution:** Read all 10 transcript files across v0.1–v0.3 and created `docs/PROJECT-SCHEMA.md` with:
- What the project is (RegTech / AI Compliance SaaS, target: early-stage AI startups)
- Phased strategy: live demo first → Streamlit temporary → independent product or OpenClaw plugin
- Key architectural decisions with direct quoted sources and transcript filenames
- Version history summary, what's next, source transcript table
**Decision:** Every claim must have a source; no hallucination. File is local-only (gitignored).
**Files modified:** `docs/PROJECT-SCHEMA.md` (new file), `.gitignore` (added PROJECT-SCHEMA.md)

### Task 2: Integrate PROJECT-SCHEMA into Documentation System
**Question:** Add PROJECT-SCHEMA to DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE, DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM-MAP, and cursor rules so it stays updated with every session.
**Answer/Solution:**
- **DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md:** Added PROJECT-SCHEMA to project structure tree. Added new Section 7 (Project Schema) with purpose, contents, rules. Renumbered sections 7→11. Added to workflow step 7 and quick reference (read on start, update on end). Added missing `no-assumptions.mdc` to project structure.
- **DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM-MAP.md:** Added to local-only box in Big Picture. Added row 9 to document table. Added to session lifecycle (read #4 at start, update step 4 at end). Added to How Documents Connect (transcripts → PROJECT-SCHEMA). Added to git rules. Added `no-assumptions.mdc` to automation box.
- **.cursor/rules/documentation-system.mdc:** Added read PROJECT-SCHEMA as step 4 before work. Added update bullet: update PROJECT-SCHEMA if strategic decisions were made. Updated section refs (README=8, commit=9).
- **.cursor/rules/pre-commit-review.mdc:** Added documentation check for PROJECT-SCHEMA when strategic decisions made.
**Decision:** PROJECT-SCHEMA is updated only when strategic decisions occur (product direction, target users, architectural decisions), not every session.
**Files modified:** `docs/DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md`, `docs/DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM-MAP.md`, `.cursor/rules/documentation-system.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/pre-commit-review.mdc`

### Task 3: Session Not Yet Logged
**Question:** Is this chat session logged in dev log?
**Answer:** No. Wrote this dev log.
**Decision:** N/A

## Key Decisions Made

1. PROJECT-SCHEMA is local-only — sourced quotes from transcripts may reference personal info.
2. Agent should proactively update PROJECT-SCHEMA when detecting strategic decisions ("I want to pivot...", "my plan is to...", "I'm targeting...").
3. Every claim in PROJECT-SCHEMA must have a direct quote and transcript filename — no inference.
