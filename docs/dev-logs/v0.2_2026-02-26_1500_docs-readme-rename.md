# Dev Log: Documentation System Improvements, README Update & Repo Rename

**Version:** v0.2
**Date:** 2026-02-26

## What Happened in This Session

### Task 1: Repo Name Discussion
**Question:** User wanted to add "ai" to the repo name (`compliance-gap-analyzer` → something with AI prefix). Asked for suggestions.
**Options discussed:** `ai-compliance-gap-analyzer`, `ai-compliance-analyzer`, `compliance-gap-analyzer-ai`, `ai-regulatory-compliance-analyzer`, `aicga`
**Decision:** Go with `ai-compliance-gap-analyzer` — maps 1:1 to the product name, descriptive, the "gap" part is distinctive.
**Action:** User renamed on GitHub and updated local remote. Agent updated all internal references.

### Task 2: Add README Update Rules to Documentation System
**Question:** README was getting stale — no rule enforced keeping it up to date.
**Solution:** Added new Section 7 (README.md) to `DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md` with:
- List of what the README contains
- Trigger table (when X changes → update Y in README)
- Rules for keeping it concise and current
- Added README step to version workflow (step 6) and AI quick reference
**Files modified:** `docs/DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md` (new section, renumbered 7→10), `.cursor/rules/documentation-system.mdc` (added README reminder)

### Task 3: Sync Cursor Rules with Documentation Guide
**Question:** Cursor rule was out of sync — missing HHMM in dev log format, missing commit suggestion step.
**Solution:** Updated `.cursor/rules/documentation-system.mdc` to add `<HHMM>` to dev log naming and add commit message suggestion step.
**Files modified:** `.cursor/rules/documentation-system.mdc`

### Task 4: Create Local-Only Documentation System Map
**Question:** Documentation system is growing complex — user wanted a clean visual reference for how it all fits together.
**Solution:** Created `docs/DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM-MAP.md` (gitignored) with:
- Big picture diagram (public vs local vs automation)
- Table of every document with who creates/updates it
- Session lifecycle flow (agent vs human responsibilities)
- Document connection diagram
- Version bump checklist
- Naming conventions quick reference
- Git rules summary
**Files modified:** `docs/DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM-MAP.md` (new), `.gitignore` (added ignore rule)

### Task 5: Update README to v0.2 + Rename References
**Question:** README was still showing v0.1 state. Also needed to reflect new repo name.
**Solution:** Comprehensive README update:
- Status: v0.1 → v0.2
- Architecture diagram: added `append_test_log()` step
- Sample reports: replaced single link with link to `reports/` folder
- Project structure: renamed to `ai-compliance-gap-analyzer/`, added `test-log.csv`
- Installation: updated clone URL and cd
- Usage: rewrote with CLI scenario commands and examples
- Known Issues: replaced v0.1 bugs with v0.2 remaining issues
- Roadmap: checked off 4 items, added 1 new
- Current version: v0.1 → v0.2 with link
- Also updated `docs/DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md` structure tree with new repo name
**Files modified:** `README.md`, `docs/DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md`

## Key Decisions Made
1. Repo renamed to `ai-compliance-gap-analyzer` — matches product name, clear and descriptive
2. Historical references in dev logs and transcripts left unchanged (they document what happened at the time)
3. README rules focus on triggers (what changed → what to update) rather than prescribing exact content
4. Documentation system map is local-only — it's a personal reference, not part of the published project
